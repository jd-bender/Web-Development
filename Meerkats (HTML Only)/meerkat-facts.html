		<p>Meerkats are small carnivores that belong to the mongoose family. They
		are located in multiple parts of Africa, and organize themselves into clans.
		These clans are usually composed of around 20 members, but some can have
		up to 50 or more! They are burrowing creatures, and live in large underground
		networks that they only leave during the day.	</p>
